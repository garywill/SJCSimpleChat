SJCSimpleChat
=============

This repo contains three things:

1. A set of classes based on Apple's [WiTap example code][http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/WiTap/Introduction/Intro.html] which advertise and find each other via bonjour and then create a socket connection over which data can be transfered.
2. A set of classes for implementing a simple chat client.
3. An example chat server daemon.

This repo also contains a copy of Apple's TCPServer class.
